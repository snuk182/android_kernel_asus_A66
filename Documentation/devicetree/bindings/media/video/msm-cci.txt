* Qualcomm MSM CCI

Required properties:
- cell-index: cci hardware core index
- compatible :
    - "qcom,cci"
- reg : offset and length of the register set for the device
    for the cci operating in compatible mode.
- reg-names : should specify relevant names to each reg property defined.
- interrupts : should contain the cci interrupt.
- interrupt-names : should specify relevant names to each interrupts
  property defined.

* Qualcomm MSM ACTUATOR

Required properties:
- cell-index : should contain unique identifier to differentiate
    between multiple actuators
- reg : should contain i2c slave address of the actuator and length of
    data field which is 0x0
- compatible :
    - "qcom,actuator"
- qcom,cci-master : should contain i2c master id to be used for this camera
    sensor
    - 0 -> MASTER 0
    - 1 -> MASTER 1

Example:

   qcom,cci@0xfda0c000 {
       cell-index = <0>;
       compatible = "qcom,cci";
       reg = <0xfda0c000 0x300>;
       reg-names = "cci";
       interrupts = <0 50 0>;
       interrupt-names = "cci";
   };
